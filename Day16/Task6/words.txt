The robotics was a lot of fun, and opening the Kibo (JEM - Japanese Experiment Module) and flying in there for the first time was really something.
At first it did not have any panels or racks installed, and so we had most of the cylindrical volume open.
It was, and still is, by far, the largest and most open volume within the station.
For a few wild and crazy minutes we had 10 people flying around in all directions.
Then back to work, and the next several days involved installing system and science racks, hooking everything up to cooling, power, data, air-flow, etc.
